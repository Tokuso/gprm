GBI can be of type Number (Integer/Float/Bool) or String

A problem is that GLex and GArg can also have these types.

So I guess the best solution is to have a tuple-type with
the RetVal and the type info for the retval, ie
GDataType. OTOH, GDataType only makes sense if GRetVal is a Symbol
So maybe only GSymbol needs to be a tuple

Considering that a Gannet Symbol has all the necessary type info in the 
Kind and Datatype fields, where do we store the additional type info?

Assuming T_d to be used for GData and T_x for GAny, we can store that info
in the reference in the SLH. However, we can't store the Kind of the 
return value there. So it is better to have a separate retvaltype field in the SLH
At runtime, all we care about is T_I, T_F, T_S, T_b or T_d



Type inference:

-If it's a symbol it's trivial, unless it's a service symbol
-However, we should update the datatype field of the ref symbol in the SLH

-However 2, if a symbol has a definite type, we can use it to set the type in the SLH.
The same is true for an expression with a definite type.

LET/BEGIN
As it is not easy to know if a symbol will be the last to be appended to the list,
we can simply say that for let, we always set the SLH type to the symbol/expr type.
Consequenlty, the last symbol/expr to be appended will determine the type

RETURN
This is slightly more difficult. The type should be that of the first symbol to
be appended after the service symbol. So we should check the last element
of the SL via head $ reverse $ getSL st. If that is a K_S, it's OK

ASSIGN
if the symbol is NOT K_L (or K_Q) and it has a definite type, we can set this type for the READ SLH.
What we do is determine the type if the binding expression, then "back up" and modify the previous symbol;
to make the type available to READ, we should add the type information to the context, i.e. update the Gannet Symbol
in the context.

READ
if the symbol is K_L, it should be possible to find the corresponding ASSIGN and get the type from there.
A possible way is to make sure the Scope table is updated with the new type. Then we look up the scope table,
get the type, set it on th eK_L symbol and on the READ SLH

IF
Here we must know if it's not the condition expression. So if the last element of the list is K_S
then don't change the SLH else it's OK

LAMBDA
The return value of LAMBDA is (probably) that of the function body.
So if we're in LAMBDA and we encounter an expression, it's OK

APPLY
The return value of APPLY is that of the LAMBDA and thus that of the READ.


However, we should try to create the signature of the LAMBDA from the infered
types of APPLYs arguments.
 I guess we could take a similar approach to ASSIGN/READ: set the type on the K_A's in the scope.
 It's slightly more complicated: first we must get the LAMBDA expression to get the K_A's.
 This is difficult, I think it would be best to store LAMBDA expressions (e.g. in the context).
 The problem is that we don't really bind the K_L's at compile time, so we can't simply lookup
 the LAMBDA based on the variable.
(assign 'v (lambda 'x 'y ...))
(apply (read 'v) e1 e2 ...)

{ v => (lambda 'x 'y ...), ... }

So we should add a field to the Context, a Map between the full variable name i.e. (kind,subtask,name)
and the SymbolTree it stores.
In principle we could do the same for K_A values but in practice this is much more convoluted:
-get LAMBDA via the K_L
-get K_A's
-map to APPLY args
-store 
-and yes, we could at the same time set the types on the K_A's in the Scope. 

After doing all that, I think we need another iteration, so we walk the SymbolTree
again and this time we set the datatype of K_A symbols to the value in the ScopeTable.
But I'm afraid that is not enough. e.g.
(if (< n 1) '(return acc) ...)
We  can set the datatype for n and acc. Essentially it amounts to this:
K_A will be T_i, T_f, T_s or T_d but hopefully not T_x (as that would mean unresolved)
